1. what is routing ?
---------------------
	1. Routing in ASP.NET is a powerful mechanism that directs incoming HTTP requests to the appropriate controller actions.
	2. It enables you to create clean and structured URLs for your web application and provides flexibility in defining custom routes and constraints.

Types of Routing in ASP.NET:
1. Convention-Based Routing
2. Attribute-Based Routing
	
2. what is conventional routing ?
----------------------------------
	1. Routes are defined based on conventions (e.g., controller/action names).
	2. is an approach that uses a predefined pattern to map requests to controller actions.
	3. example, if a user navigates to https://example.com/Products/GetProduct/42, the GetProduct action will be invoked with id equal to 42.

3. what is attribute routing ?
------------------------------
	1. Attribute routing in ASP.NET (including both MVC and Web API) allows you to define routes directly on actions and controllers using attributes. 
	2. Attribute routing uses the [Route] attribute to define routes.
	3. You apply this attribute to controller classes or action methods.
	4. It provides more control over URIs compared to conventional routing.
	5. In this case, the [HttpGet("{id}")] attribute specifies that the GetProduct action should respond to requests with the specified URL pattern.
	6. Now, when a user visits https://example.com/api/products/42, the GetProduct action will handle it.
